;[meta_bdb]
; name of replication group, default is `tubemqMasterGroup`, you'd better set individual value for every tubeMQ cluster
;repGroupName=tubemqMasterGroup

;repNodePort=9001
; bdb meta data path; can be absolute, or relative to TubeMQ base directory ($BASE_DIR)
;   optional, default is "var/meta_data"
;   should be the same to `[bdbStore].bdbEnvHome` if upgrade from version prior 0.5.0
;   or `[master].metaDataPath` if upgrade from version prior 1.0.0
;metaDataPath=var/meta_data
; helperHost(and port) for node to join master cluster and the port should keep consistent with `repNodePort`; for the

;repHelperHost=masterHostName:9001
; meta data disk sync policy
;   the overall durability is a function of metaLocalSyncPolicy plus the repReplicaAckPolicy used by the master,

;   see https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17277_02/html/java/com/sleepycat/je/Durability.html for detail
;   1 for SYNC, will write and synchronously flush the log to disk upon transaction commit
;   2 for NO_SYNC, do not synchronously flush the log upon transaction commit (if application or system fails, data may lost)
;   3 for WRITE_NO_SYNC, synchronously written to the OS's file system buffers upon transaction commit, but the data is not
;     actually forced to disk(if the system fails,data may lost)
