# Replicated Attributes

#### Background

Users want knowledge of how the entities have landed into Atlas instance, if they were created via hook ingestion or whether they were imported from another Atlas instance.

This is addressed by 2 new attributes that are now part of _Referenceable_ entity type viz. _replicatedFrom_ and _replicatedTo_.
