 Logging settings for the Drill-on-YARN application master.
 See http://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html for more information.

 YARN already captures stdout and stderr, and the AM produces
 moderate amount of logging, so the logging simply goes to stdout
 and from there into the YARN-provided output log directory.
