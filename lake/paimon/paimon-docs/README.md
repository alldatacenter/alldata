# Documentation generators

This module contains generators that create HTML files directly from Paimon's source code.

## Configuration documentation

The `ConfigOptionsDocGenerator` can be used to generate a reference of `ConfigOptions`. By default, a separate file is generated for each `*Options` class found in `org.apache.paimon`, `org.apache.paimon.flink` and `org.apache.paimon.flink.kafka`. 
The `@ConfigGroups` annotation can be used to generate multiple files from a single class.

To integrate an `*Options` class from another package, add another module-package argument pair to `ConfigOptionsDocGenerator#LOCATIONS`.

The files can be generated by running `mvn package -Pgenerate-docs -pl paimon-docs -nsu -DskipTests`, and can be integrated into the documentation using `{{ include generated/<file-name> >}}`.

**NOTE:** You need to make sure that the changed jar has been installed in the local maven repository.

The documentation must be regenerated whenever
* an `*Options` class was added or removed
* a `ConfigOption` was added to or removed from an `*Options` class
* a `ConfigOption` was modified in any way.
