/**
 * An interface for building the {@link TableScan} and {@link TableRead}.
 *
 * <p>Example of distributed reading:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // 1. Create a ReadBuilder (Serializable)
 * Table table = catalog.getTable(...);
 * ReadBuilder builder = table.newReadBuilder()
 *     .withFilter(...)
 *     .withProjection(...);
 *
 * // 2. Plan splits in 'Coordinator' (or named 'Driver'):
 * List<Split> splits = builder.newScan().plan().splits();
 *
 * // 3. Distribute these splits to different tasks
 *
 * // 4. Read a split in task
 * TableRead read = builder.newRead();
 * RecordReader<InternalRow> reader = read.createReader(split);
 * reader.forEachRemaining(...);
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>{@link #newStreamScan()} will create a stream scan, which can perform continuously planning:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * TableScan scan = builder.newStreamScan();
 * while (true) {
 *     List<Split> splits = scan.plan().splits();
 *     ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: {@link InternalRow} cannot be saved in memory. It may be reused internally, so you need
 * to convert it into your own data structure or copy it.
