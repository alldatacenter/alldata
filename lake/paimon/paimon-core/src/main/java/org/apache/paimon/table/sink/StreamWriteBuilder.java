/**
 * An interface for building the {@link StreamTableWrite} and {@link StreamTableCommit}.
 *
 * <p>Key points to achieve exactly-once consistency:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>CommitUser represents a user. A user can commit multiple times. In distributed processing,
 *       you are expected to use the same commitUser.
 *   <li>Different applications need to use different commitUsers.
 *   <li>The commitIdentifier of {@link StreamTableWrite} and {@link StreamTableCommit} needs to be
 *       consistent, and the id needs to be incremented for the next committing.
 *   <li>When a failure occurs, if you still have uncommitted {@link CommitMessage}s, please use
 *       {@link StreamTableCommit#filterCommitted} to exclude the committed messages by
 *       commitIdentifier.
 * </ul>
