     * Create a new commit. One commit may generate up to two snapshots, one for adding new files
     * and the other for compaction. There will be some expiration policies after commit:
     *
     * <p>1. Snapshot expiration may occur according to three options:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>'snapshot.time-retained': The maximum time of completed snapshots to retain.
     *   <li>'snapshot.num-retained.min': The minimum number of completed snapshots to retain.
     *   <li>'snapshot.num-retained.max': The maximum number of completed snapshots to retain.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>2. Partition expiration may occur according to 'partition.expiration-time'. The partition
     * check is expensive, so all partitions are not checked every time when invoking this method.
     * The check frequency is controlled by 'partition.expiration-check-interval'. Partition
     * expiration will create an 'OVERWRITE' snapshot.
     *
