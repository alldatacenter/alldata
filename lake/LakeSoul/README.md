# LakeSoul
LakeSoul is a cloud-native Lakehouse framework developed by [DMetaSoul](https://www.dmetasoul.com) team, and supports scalable metadata management, ACID transactions, efficient and flexible upsert operation, schema evolution, and unified streaming & batch processing.
![LakeSoul Arch](doc/LakeSoul.png)

LakeSoul implements incremental upserts for both row and column and allows concurrent updates. LakeSoul uses LSM-Tree like structure to support updates on hash partitioning table with primary key, and achieve very high write throughput (30MB/s/core) on cloud object store like S3 while providing optimized merge on read performance. LakeSoul scales metadata management and achieves ACID control by using PostgreSQL. LakeSoul provides tools to ingest CDC and log streams automatically in a zero-ETL style.
